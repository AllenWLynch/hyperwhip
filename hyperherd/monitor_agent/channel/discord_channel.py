"""Discord transport for the monitor daemon.

Connects to Discord as a bot, finds or creates a text channel for the
sweep inside the configured guild, and uses it as both the agent's
notification surface and the inbox for user replies.

Three message paths in the channel:

1. **Slash commands** (`/status`, `/stop`, `/tail`, `/help`, …) — handled
   locally via `monitor_agent.commands` without invoking the agent.
   Discord's UI provides typed parameter prompts.
2. **Mentions / replies** (`@HerdDog ...` or replying to a bot message)
   — stripped of the mention and routed to the daemon's inbox handler,
   which wakes the loop so the agent can respond on the next tick.
3. **Plain channel messages** — ignored. The channel is shared; people
   can chat without summoning the agent.

Setup steps the user does once per Discord server:

1. Create an application + bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
2. Enable the **MESSAGE CONTENT** privileged gateway intent on the bot.
3. Generate an invite URL with scopes `bot` + `applications.commands`
   and the permissions `View Channels`, `Send Messages`,
   `Read Message History`, `Manage Channels`.
4. Invite the bot to their server.
5. Copy the bot token → `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` env var.
6. Right-click the server name (Developer Mode on) → Copy Server ID →
   `discord.guild_id` in `hyperherd.yaml`.

Restart the daemon. It registers slash commands per-guild on first
connect (instant; global sync would take an hour to propagate).

One bot token per daemon: Discord enforces a single gateway connection
per token, so two daemons sharing a token will keep kicking each other
off. If you're running multiple sweeps in parallel, create one bot per
sweep workspace and put each token in its own `.env`. The startup
preflight (`_check_for_token_conflicts`) detects the same-token case
by reading per-channel heartbeat markers (written by `_heartbeat_loop`
into the channel's topic field) and refuses to start with an actionable
error. On clean shutdown the marker is cleared so a quick restart
isn't blocked. `--force-discord` bypasses the check after an unclean
kill.
