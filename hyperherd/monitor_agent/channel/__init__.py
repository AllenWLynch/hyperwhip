"""Transport-agnostic chat channel for the monitor daemon.

The daemon wants two things from whatever chat platform it's connected to:

1. **Outbound**: send a body of text. (`post`)
2. **Inbound**: receive user messages and route them into the per-tick inbox.

This module defines a `MessageChannel` Protocol that hides the concrete
transport (Discord today, Slack tomorrow), plus an `InboundEvent` dataclass
matching the shape `state.InboundMessage` expects.

Concrete implementations live in sibling modules (e.g. `discord_channel.py`).
A `build_channel(config, sweep_name)` factory picks one based on the
workspace config; if no channel is configured, it returns None and the
daemon runs without a chat surface (using the legacy webhook path for
outbound only).
