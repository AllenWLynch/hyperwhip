"""Deterministic per-tick state assembler.

Runs in pure Python before the agent is invoked. Pulls a fresh `herd
snapshot`, rotates the previous-tick snapshot for delta detection, drains
the inbox of any user messages received since last tick, and packages it
all into a single `TickState` the agent's `read_state()` tool returns.

The agent never calls `herd snapshot`, never reads the manifest, never
diffs anything itself — that's the point.
