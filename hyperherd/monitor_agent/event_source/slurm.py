"""SLURM polling event source.

Periodically asks `herd snapshot` for the sweep state, diffs trial-status
sets against the previous poll, and:

1. Pushes `WakeEvent("failure")` / `WakeEvent("completion")` into the
   daemon's queue so the agent ticks promptly on consequential events.
2. Posts a one-line notification into the chat channel for each
   transition (trial started running, trial completed, trial failed).
   These are non-agent posts — emoji-prefixed, no model spend, fire the
   moment SLURM reports the transition.

The post + tick split lets the user see "trial 3 started running" the
instant SLURM picks it up, and then a few seconds later (when the
agent's tick fires), the agent's policy decision. Two different
signals, two different voices.

Why polling instead of `sacct --json` directly: `herd snapshot` already
encapsulates all the manifest-aware logic (slurm job IDs to trial
indices, status mapping, etc.); reusing it keeps this module thin and
ensures the poller and the per-tick state assembler agree on what a
trial's status is.
