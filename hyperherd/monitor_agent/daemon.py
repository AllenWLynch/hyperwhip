"""Daemon mode: schedule + event-driven loop on top of run_tick().

The agent picks the next-tick delay via `schedule_next`; the daemon
sleeps that long, races the timer against any event the sources push
into the wake queue, and runs another tick. SIGINT/SIGTERM trigger a
clean exit at the next iteration boundary.

Event sources running alongside the loop:

- The `MessageChannel`'s inbox writer pushes `WakeEvent("user_message")`
  when a user @-mentions the bot or replies to one of its posts.
- `SlurmPoll` (Phase 3) pushes `WakeEvent("failure")` /
  `WakeEvent("completion")` on trial-state transitions.

Final-stop notification: when the loop exits (halt or signal), the
daemon posts one "stopped" message through the channel (or webhook
fallback) so the user sees the daemon is no longer running.
