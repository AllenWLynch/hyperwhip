# Try the bundled MNIST example

The repo ships a complete end-to-end sweep at `examples/mnist_training/`. PyTorch Lightning + Hydra trainer, 11 trials sweeping learning rate × optimizer, conditional rules that prune unstable combinations and inject extras for `adamw` and `sgd`. Clone, install, run — you can have it on the queue in two minutes.

## What the example does

A 4-step learning rate (1e-4 → 1e-1, log-scaled) crossed with three optimizers (`adam`, `sgd`, `adamw`) — 12 combinations, reduced to 11 after a condition drops `sgd` at `lr > 0.05` (it's unstable). Each trial trains a small MLP on MNIST for 50 epochs and logs:

- **Final** `test_acc` / `test_loss` / `best_val_acc` via plain `log_result(name, value)` — these show up in `herd res`.
- **Streaming** `val_loss` / `val_acc` per validation epoch via `log_result(name, value, step=trainer.global_step)`, wired in through a `HyperHerdStreamCallback` in `train.py`. The autonomous monitor's `compute_metric` reads these for pruning decisions.

The config showcases all four condition forms — programmatic predicate, literal-extra injection, expression-computed extra, structured force — so you can see what the YAML looks like beyond the bare minimum.

## Run it

```bash
# Install HyperHerd from PyPI:
pip install hyperherd

# Clone the repo to get the example workspace (the example files
# aren't shipped in the wheel — only the CLI is):
git clone https://github.com/AllenWLynch/hyperherd.git
cd hyperherd

# Install the trial-side training deps (PyTorch + Lightning + Hydra):
pip install -r examples/mnist_training/requirements.txt

# Edit examples/mnist_training/hyperherd.yaml: change `slurm.partition`
# to one your cluster has. Defaults to `short`.

# Preview the sweep — no SLURM submission, just shows the trial table:
herd run examples/mnist_training/ --dry-run

# Submit:
herd run examples/mnist_training/

# Watch the run by hand:
herd status examples/mnist_training/
herd stats examples/mnist_training/
herd tail examples/mnist_training/ 0
```

When trials finish:

```bash
herd res examples/mnist_training/
```

prints a TSV of every trial's parameters and final metrics.

## Or hand it to the monitor

If you've done the [Discord setup](discord-setup.md) once, point the daemon at the example workspace:

```bash
pip install '.[monitor]'
herd monitor examples/mnist_training/
```

The daemon will:

1. Auto-init the manifest if you haven't run `herd run` yet.
2. Connect to your Discord server, create a `#mnist-sweep` channel.
3. Walk you through the 3-question setup interview in that channel.
4. Run the canary (trial 0), then phase 2 (trials 1–2), then the rest.
5. Diagnose failures, post heartbeats, summarize the result when it's done.

You drive it from the channel — `/status`, `/run 5`, `/cancel 3`, `/tail 7`, or `@HerdDog please bump mem to 4G`.

## Things to play with

Once you have it running, edit `examples/mnist_training/hyperherd.yaml` and re-run — HyperHerd reconciles:

- Add `0.5` to `dropout.values` → 4 new trials get appended on the next `herd run`, existing ones stay.
- Change `grid` from `[learning_rate, optimizer]` to `all` → full Cartesian (with constraint pruning) — many more trials.
- Add a `static_overrides: ["max_epochs=10"]` → faster iteration for debugging.
- Edit a condition to invert it (`> 0.05` → `< 0.05`) → see the constraint engine prune a different chunk of the grid.

Anything you change persists on subsequent runs — no manifest regeneration needed.

If you also ran `herd monitor`, you'll see `MONITOR_PLAN.md`, `chat-history.jsonl`, `agent_log.jsonl`, and a few snapshot files alongside.
